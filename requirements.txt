# For ARM64 (Raspberry Pi), use version 2.0.0 which has better compatibility
# For x86_64, you can use the latest version
agora-python-server-sdk==2.0.0
# On Raspberry Pi, opencv-python may fail to build. Use system package instead:
# sudo apt install python3-opencv
# Or try the headless version:
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0
